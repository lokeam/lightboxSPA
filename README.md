# Lightbox SPA
Simple single page web application built using JavaScript. Plain CSS styling with [BEM](http://getbem.com/) syntax. No frameworks or build tools used or needed to run. Mobile viewport friendly.

Loads data from a test API using a lightweight XHR HTTP client and dynamically adjusts the width of the lightbox upon scroll.

As user scrolls down the page, the width of the lightbox shrinks until it is one third it's original width at the top of the page.

## Usage
Runs on [http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html](http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html) in all modern web browsers (IE < 10 not supported).
*Note: usage of port 5500 is not required, any unused port may suffice.*
